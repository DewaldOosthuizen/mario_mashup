# retro_mashup
Retro Mashup created with Godot 3. A 2D game representing our old retro game styles.
It is a sigle playable level from the retro_apocalypse game that is in the making.

This will be a community driven game and anyone will be able to use this project as a baseline and create
your own game or you can add onto this game and build a community edition of retro_apocalypse.
